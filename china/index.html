Noah has focused on private equity and is known for its close relationships with leading fund managers, including some like Sequoia and Hillhouse that are difficult to access. Sequoia China owns 5.3% of Noah acquired in 2007

Two main sources of income:
Wealth Management earns sales commissions and participation in base management and performance fees for funds it distributes.
Asset Management operates Private Equity funds (including Fund of Funds, feeder funds, and co-investment funds) and earns management and performance fees.
In 2023 the company adopted a policy to distribute a dividend of at least 35% of annual income  and that a total of up to 50% could be used for dividends and share buyback.

Key risk: 
US-China relations ie There’s no certainty that the company will always be able to withdraw funds from China in the future.
Fraud has been a concern in any China-related investment.
